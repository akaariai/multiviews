A proof of concept of generic object multiviews.

By using something like this you can somewhat easily create declaratively
views for an object for single class.

Usage of the examples:
  1. Add 'multiview' to INSTALLED_APPS
  2. syncdb
  3. Link the generic multiviews to urls.py:
     - for each multiview add a line like this:
     SingleFieldViews.urls(prefix=r'singlefield/'),
     to patterns
  4. Use it! runserver + point browers to /singlefield/ or
     /multifield/

You can check the views.py for how the views are defined and how they work.
The class SingleFieldViews is an example of a simple multiview.

This is just a proof-of-concept. With some more meta-programming the
declarative part of creating a new view could be DRYed up a little. More
hooks would be needed. Make the templates actually nice. And so on.
